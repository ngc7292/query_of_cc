This project is dataset and model checkpoints for the paper "Query of CC: Unearthing Large Scale Domain-Specific Knowledge from Public Corpora".

We are currently organizing the project and awaiting approval. Coming soon! Happy chinese new year!

## Introduction

We propose an efficient data collection method *Query of CC* based on large language models (see the figure below). This method bootstraps seed information through a large language model and retrieves related data from public corpora. It not only collects knowledge-related data for specific domains but unearths the data with potential reasoning procedures. Through the application of this method, we have curated a high-quality dataset called **Knowledge Pile**, encompassing four major domains, including stem and humanities sciences, among others.
